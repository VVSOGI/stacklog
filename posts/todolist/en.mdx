# About this project

“It's important for developers to have the experience of recreating a project they've made before.” The TODOLIST web app is a project that people often make to evaluate their skills. This TODOLIST was made in late 2024 and is a mono repository using yarn. The frontend is component-tested code using Storybook, and the backend is more rigorously unit-tested using Jest + typia.

## Presenter Container Pattern

In the Next.js project, we adopted the Presenter Container pattern for separation of concerns. For each page, we created a Presenter component named 'Display' to be in charge of UI rendering, and separated data processing and business logic by utilizing custom hooks as Containers. With this structure, Presenter is only responsible for receiving and displaying data, and logic such as data fetching and state management is handled by Containers (custom hooks) to clearly separate responsibilities between components.

## Separate npm packages to solve the problem of sharing UI components between Storybook and Frontend

The frontend was packaged to manage duplicate code to address the growing overall size of the project and the issue of sharing UI components with the storybook. The frontend and storybook switched to installing and using the components they needed from npm. The above process decoupled a large amount of code, and we were able to reduce the frontend docker build time by 38.6%.

I've written about these results in issue 232 below.

## Documenting API workflows with PlantUML

In order to visualize the progress of the API process between endpoints on the server, the code was written using PlantUML. The link below is the workflow for the category endpoint.

## Why Typia and how it works

Typia is a library that allows you to validate TypeScript's pure type definitions at runtime, delivering performance up to 20,000 times faster than class-validators. It works by letting the TypeScript compiler analyze types and automatically generate optimized validation code, eliminating the possibility of mismatches between type definitions and validation logic without the need to define schemas or decorators.

With Typia, we tested against the DTO validation object used in production and validated various edge cases, resulting in 41 additional test cases that we were able to validate more rigorously. As the number of test cases increases, the reliability of server behavior increases, so we can see that test coverage and server reliability have a proportional relationship.

## Automating deployments with Docker

In our project infrastructure, the PostgreSQL database, backend server, frontend client, and storybook server are all managed as Docker containers. We utilized Docker Compose to categorize our services into infra, services, and development profiles, and all containers are connected to the same network (todolist) so that they can communicate with each other. We used the shell scripts deploy-local.sh and deploy-production.sh to separate commands for different environments. This system has greatly improved our development productivity and the reliability of our deployment process.
